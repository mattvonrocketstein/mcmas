# MCMAS

A mirror of the MCMAS project.  MCMAS is an open-source, OBDD-based symbolic model checker tailored to the verification of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). MAS descriptions are given by means of ISPL (Interpreted Systems Programming Language) programs. ISPL is an agent-based, modular language inspired by interpreted systems, a popular semantics in MAS.

Currently pinned to 1.3.0.  See the [official page at SAIL](https://sail.doc.ic.ac.uk/software/mcmas/), [docs folder](docs/), [original README](README).
